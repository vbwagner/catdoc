INSTALLING catdoc 0.96

Since catdoc version 0.96 the project is using Meson build.

So typically you should run
./configure
make
make install

to compile and install catdoc.

./configure help
	Will display what can be configured, such as:
	meson configure build -Dprefix=/tmp/catdoc

The -D values below are current build defaults.

-Dbuild_wordview=true
	Choose whether to build Tcl/Tk viewer wordview, which requires X11.
        (note, it would be disabled automatically, if you don't have
        appropriate version of Tcl/Tk).  You may wish to use this if you
        don't have X installed.

-Dwish_path='/usr/bin/env wish'
	Specify path to wish interpreter.  This option have two uses
	  1. If executable named wish, found in your PATH is old, and you
	     have newer wish installed as wish4.2 or wish8.0, you should
	     specify this in order to build wordview viewer
	  2. If you are compiling catdoc from telnet connection or text
	     console, you can specify this option to skip tcl version check,
	     which would run wish and fail if it couldn't find X display
	     (which would lead configure to assume, that you don't have good
	     wish)

-Dinput_charset=cp1251
-Doutput_charset=koi8-r
        Allows you to specify charset names to expect in 8-bit word file and
	to produce as output text file.  Do ls ./charsets/*.txt to find out
	which charsets are provided in distribution.  Additional charsets
	can be obtained from <ftp.unicode.org> Note that make would fail if
	you specify charset, which doesn't exist in charset directory.

	Notice that it is possible to define none-existing charset as input
	our output charset.  If you do this it is your responsibility to
	provide charset files in catdoc library directory after make
	install.

-Duse_langinfo=true
	By default, catdoc tries to use your current locale charset as its
	output charset.  It can be, of cource always overriden by command
	line switch.  But charset from the locale takes precedence over
	charset in configuration file, unless you put use_locale=no into
	this file.

	If your C library is not XPG4-compatible, and configure fails to
	detect it, you can completely disable langinfo support using this
	switch.
